            <h1><del>PRIVACY POLICY</del></h1>
            <p>Privacy Policies are composed of a few common elements that should be present in every situation.</p> <p>Beyond that, different clauses will be included depending on the types of services your app or website offers.</p>
            <p>For example, a website that processes credit card information will have a section in its Privacy Policy</p> <p>discussing how that credit card information is encrypted and stored so as to keep it from unauthorized access.</p>
            <p>In this section, you will find a variety of clauses that are commonly included in Privacy Policies depending on the services offered.</p> <p>Clauses such as these will be mixed and matched to create your Privacy Policy,</p> 
            <p>with each clause being individually tweaked to suit your specific needs.</p>
